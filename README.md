# Julian Harris's Blog

Hello, I'm Julian 🥑

I'm a security engineer that enjoys being immersed in new things and connecting with teams to improve organizational security.

With a little over 11 years of experience in the security industry, my primary focus is application security. I've been in the Air Force Reserves for just about the same amount of time and currently perform capability development when on orders.

Most recently I work on the Application Security team at [H-E-B Grocery](https://heb.com)
to make our developer's lives easier when building applications to secure Texans' ability to
buy groceries. This takes on the form of creating builder patterns, compliance, manual application 
security reviews, automated scanning, and more.
